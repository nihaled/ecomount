            <p class="text-white py-4">A scientist in every act, word, and deed, Dr. Abdul Salam sees matters from a different
              perspective. He gives a new dimension to the mundane and quickly identifies
              opportunities in what comes in front of him. He has earned his academic credentials
              from prestigious institutions in India and abroad, and has spent over three decades
              leading groundbreaking initiatives that have transformed the future.
              In a career spanning more than three decades, after completing B. Tech from NIT, M.
              Tech from Aligarh Muslim University, and a Ph.D. from the Malaysian Institute of
              Technology, he chose to become an advisor, scientist, strategic consultant, and head of
              departments on many development projects across India and abroad. He was the
              executive advisor for AL Munawwara development projects, as well as a consultant for
              the Abu Dhabi government's property management sector and the Al Mukarrama Land
              Management project in Saudi Arabia. He also worked as the head of planning and
              projects for the public works departments in Qatar as well as an officer in the Planning
              Commission's National Informatics Center, besides his stint at ISRO in the role of a
              scientist.
              He came back to India to create the first-of-its-kind Markaz Knowledge City with cutting-
              edge education, technology, and healthcare institutions surrounded by a group of other
              companies that complete the perfect new generation city. At Ecomount, he drives the
              sustainable vision of the brand through scientific interventions. His passion for science
              and strategic thinking has made him a valuable asset to every project he has
              undertaken, cementing his reputation as an exceptional leader and innovator.</p>
